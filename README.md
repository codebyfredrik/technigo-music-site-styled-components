# Music site

### Summary

A music site created with React to display new album and single releases on Spotify.

### Implementation details

In this project I created an application that display new album and single releases on Spotify. For this particular design I decided to use CSS grid to get the layout and responsiveness done in the right way.

Before I started to code I divided the UI into smaller UI elements to get an mental idea of what kind of React components I would need for the project.

When it comes to styling of the project I decided to use Styled Components for a couple of reasons:

- Generates unique class names for styles and prevents styling conflicts
- Dynamic styling is possible with properties or a global theme
- Automatic vendor prefixing

### Technologies used

- Javascript
- React
- CSS
- Styled Components
- HTML
